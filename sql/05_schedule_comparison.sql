-- Question:
-- Does the number of training days per week affect attendance?
--
-- Cohorts 2 to 5 used a three-day week (MWF), while Cohort 6
-- used a five-day week (MTWTF).


SELECT
    c.schedule,
    ROUND(100 * SUM(a.status IN ('Present', 'Late')) / COUNT(*), 1
    ) AS attendance_rate,
    COUNT(*) AS n

FROM attendance a
JOIN enrolments e ON a.enrolment_id = e.enrolment_id
JOIN cohorts c ON e.cohort_id = c.cohort_id

WHERE a.status <> 'Not Recorded'
GROUP BY c.schedule;

-- Result:
-- Attendance is almost the same under both schedules:
-- 58.0% for the five day week and 58.9% for the three day week.
-- The difference is less than one percentage point, suggesting
-- that the change in weekly schedule had little difference in
-- attendance based on the available data.
