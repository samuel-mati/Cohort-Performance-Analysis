-- Question:
-- Is there a pattern in attendance before students drop out?
--
-- We compare attendance in the final 30 days before a student's
-- last recorded attendance with their attendance earlier in the course.
--
-- Since we do not have an actual dropout date, the student's
-- last recorded attendance is used as the approximate dropout point.


WITH last_attendance AS (

    -- Find the last attendance date for each student
    -- who eventually dropped out.

    SELECT
        e.enrolment_id,
        MAX(a.session_date) AS last_attendance_date

    FROM enrolments e

    JOIN attendance a
        ON a.enrolment_id = e.enrolment_id

    WHERE e.status = 'Dropped'

    GROUP BY e.enrolment_id
)


-- Compare attendance in the final 30 days
-- with attendance earlier in the course.

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN DATEDIFF(la.last_attendance_date, a.session_date) <= 30
        THEN 'Last 30 days'
        ELSE 'Earlier'
    END AS period,

    ROUND(
        100 * SUM(a.status IN ('Present', 'Late')) / COUNT(*), 1
    ) AS attendance_rate,

    COUNT(*) AS n

FROM attendance a

JOIN last_attendance la
    ON a.enrolment_id = la.enrolment_id

WHERE a.status <> 'Not Recorded'
    AND a.session_date <= la.last_attendance_date

GROUP BY period;


--
-- Result:
--
-- Attendance drops sharply before students leave.
-- Attendance is 53.8% earlier in the course but falls to
-- 16.6% in the final 30 days before their last recorded
-- attendance.
--
-- This shows that declining attendance is a clear pattern
-- among students who eventually drop out.
--
-- n represents the number of attendance records used in
-- each period, not the number of students.
